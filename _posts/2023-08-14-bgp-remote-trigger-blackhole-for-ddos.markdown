### BGP blackholing

Remotely Triggered Black Hole (RTBH) filtering is a self-managed feature that enables you to block unnecessary traffic before it enters your network. RTBH protects you from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

BGP blackhole filtering is a routing technique used to drop unwanted traffic. Black holes are placed in the parts of a network where unwanted traffic should be dropped. For example, a customer can ask a provider to install black hole on its provider edge (PE) routers to prevent unwanted traffic from entering a customerâ€™s network.

### Scope of LAB

In this lab, I am going to setup RTBH between ISP and Customer site. I will configure BGP community to place BGP Null router on specific ISP PE1 or PE2 routers. Customer has choice here to place null route to either device using BGP community. 

* To deploy null route on PE1 use BGP community 65000:777
* To deploy null route on PE2 use BGP community 65000:666

### Validation 

Let's assuming attacker (200.200.200.200) sending DDoS to customer web server (192.168.255.120) and that hogging our internet pipe. Now we will trigger RTBH request to send null route for host 192.168.255.120 from CE1 router. It will send BGP update to install null route on PE1 or PE2 device based on matching community. 

```
CE1(config)#ip route 192.168.255.120 255.255.255.255 Null0 tag 666 
```

Check BGP route on PE2. As you can see entry of 192.168.255.120/32 and Next Hop is 192.0.2.1 which is pointing to Null0 that means attacker traffic will get dropped on PE2 device. 

```
PE2#show ip bgp

    Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path
 *>   192.168.255.0    10.0.0.2                 0             0 65001 i
 *>   192.168.255.120/32
                       192.0.2.1                0             0 65001 ?
 *>i  200.200.200.0    10.1.1.1                 0    100      0 i
```

Check BGP route on PE1. As per our configuration it doesn't match BGP community so it's not going to install null route on PE1. 

```
PE1#show ip bgp

     Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path
 *>i  192.168.255.0    10.1.1.2                 0    100      0 65001 i
 *>   200.200.200.0    0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i
```

Let's remove existing null route and replace tag from 666 to 777 and see what happen. 

```
CE1(config)#no ip route 192.168.255.120 255.255.255.255 Null0 tag 666
CE1(config)#ip route 192.168.255.120 255.255.255.255 Null0 tag 777
```

Check BGP route on PE2. If you notice Next Hop is 10.0.0.2 instead of 192.0.2.1 that means we are not dropping packet on PE2 and continute forwarding. 

```
PE2#show ip bgp

    Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path
 *>   192.168.255.0    10.0.0.2                 0             0 65001 i
 *>   192.168.255.120/32
                       10.0.0.2                 0             0 65001 ?
 *>i  200.200.200.0    10.1.1.1                 0    100      0 i
```

Check BGP route on PE1. Voilla!!! Now you can see route get install in BGP table and Next Hop is 192.0.2.1 which is pointing to Null0. 

```
PE1#show ip bgp

    Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path
 *>i  192.168.255.0    10.1.1.2                 0    100      0 65001 i
 *>i  192.168.255.120/32
                       192.0.2.1                0    100      0 65001 ?
 *>   200.200.200.0    0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i
```

Using BGP community you can create more controlled way to deploy RTBH on specific entry point of network to stop attacker traffic. In next Blog I will setup Netflow to send DDoS flow to FastNetMon/goBGP tool to detect DDoS and trigger BGP RTBH automatically without any human interaction. 

Enjoy!!!
